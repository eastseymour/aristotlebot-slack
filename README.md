# Aristotle Slack Bot

A Slack bot that wraps [Aristotle Agent v2](https://aristotle.ai) for Lean theorem proving. Send `.lean` files, URLs, or natural language prompts, and the bot submits them to Aristotle and posts the results back in-thread.

## Features

- **`.lean` file uploads** — Upload a `.lean` file to the bot. It downloads the file, submits it to Aristotle in formal mode, and posts the proof back as a downloadable `.lean` file attachment.
- **URLs to `.lean` files** — Paste a URL ending in `.lean` (e.g., from GitHub). The bot downloads and processes it the same as an upload. GitHub blob URLs (e.g. `https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/main/File.lean`) are automatically converted to raw content URLs. Slack's angle-bracket URL wrapping (e.g. `<https://example.com/file.lean>`) is handled automatically.
- **Natural language** — Send any other message and the bot submits it to Aristotle in informal mode (e.g., "Prove that 1 + 1 = 2").
- **Solution file attachments** — Completed proofs are uploaded as `.lean` file attachments (not inline code blocks). The message contains a brief summary with ✅/❌ status, theorem name, and description. Filenames are derived from the theorem name when possible (e.g., `Nat.add_comm.lean`).
- **Smart bot filtering** — Only filters the bot's own messages to prevent feedback loops. Messages from other bots/apps (e.g., Klaw) are processed normally. The bot's identity is discovered dynamically at startup via `auth.test`.
- **Health check endpoint** — HTTP health check on port 8080 reporting Socket Mode connection status, event counts, and registered listeners.
- **Diagnostic logging** — Verbose logging of all incoming events with raw payloads at DEBUG level for troubleshooting.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- A [Slack app](https://api.slack.com/apps) with Socket Mode enabled
- An [Aristotle API key](https://aristotle.ai)

### Slack App Configuration

> **This is the most common cause of "zero events received".** If the bot connects to Socket Mode successfully but never receives any events, verify every step below.

1. **Create a new Slack app** at https://api.slack.com/apps
2. **Enable Socket Mode**:
   - Go to **Socket Mode** in the sidebar and toggle it ON
   - Generate an **App-Level Token** (`xapp-...`) with the `connections:write` scope
3. **Enable Event Subscriptions**:
   - Go to **Event Subscriptions** in the sidebar and toggle it ON
   - Under **Subscribe to bot events**, add:
     - `app_mention` — fires when someone @-mentions the bot
     - `message.channels` — fires for messages in public channels the bot is in
     - `message.im` — fires for direct messages to the bot
   - **Save Changes** (this is easy to forget!)
4. **Set Bot Token Scopes** (under **OAuth & Permissions**):
   - `app_mentions:read` — required for `app_mention` events
   - `chat:write` — required to post messages
   - `channels:read` — required to see channel info
   - `channels:history` — required for `message.channels` events
   - `im:history` — required for `message.im` events
   - `files:read` — required to download uploaded files
   - `files:write` — required to upload solution `.lean` files as attachments
   - `reactions:write` — required to add/remove emoji reactions
5. **Install the app** to your workspace and copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** (`xoxb-...`)
6. **Invite the bot to channels**: The bot must be a member of any channel where it should receive events. Use `/invite @aristotlebot` in each channel.

### Troubleshooting: Bot Receives Zero Events

If the bot connects via Socket Mode but receives no events:

1. **Check Event Subscriptions**: Go to https://api.slack.com/apps → your app → Event Subscriptions. Ensure it's toggled ON and the bot events (`app_mention`, `message.channels`, `message.im`) are listed.
2. **Check the health endpoint**: `curl http://localhost:8080/health` — look at `events.total_received` and `registered_listeners`.
3. **Enable DEBUG logging**: Set `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` to see raw event payloads. Lines prefixed with `[DIAG]` show exactly what events arrive.
4. **Invite the bot to the channel**: The bot must be a member of channels to receive `message.channels` events.
5. **Reinstall the app**: After changing scopes or event subscriptions, you may need to reinstall the app to your workspace.

| Variable             | Description                                 | Required |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`    | Bot User OAuth Token (`xoxb-...`)           | Yes      |
| `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`    | App-Level Token (`xapp-...`) for Socket Mode| Yes      |
| `ARISTOTLE_API_KEY`  | API key for aristotlelib                    | Yes      |
| `LOG_LEVEL`          | Logging level (default: `INFO`)             | No       |
| `HEALTH_CHECK_PORT`  | Health server port (default: `8080`)        | No       |

### Install & Run

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/eastseymour/aristotlebot-slack.git
cd aristotlebot-slack

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the package (required for module imports)
pip install -e .

# Set environment variables
export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN="xoxb-..."
export SLACK_APP_TOKEN="xapp-..."
export ARISTOTLE_API_KEY="..."

# Run the bot
python -m aristotlebot          # preferred
python main.py                  # also works
```

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t aristotlebot-slack .
docker run -e SLACK_BOT_TOKEN -e SLACK_APP_TOKEN -e ARISTOTLE_API_KEY aristotlebot-slack
```

## Usage

### Direct Messages

Send any message directly to the bot:

- **Natural language**: `Prove that for all natural numbers n, n + 0 = n`
- **URL**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repo/main/MyTheorem.lean`
- **File**: Upload a `.lean` file to the DM

### Channel @-mentions

Mention the bot in a channel:

```
@aristotlebot Prove that the square root of 2 is irrational
```

### Response Format

The bot responds in-thread with:
- An hourglass reaction while processing
- A progress message
- A brief summary: ✅ or ❌ prefix, theorem name (if detected), and a one-line description
- The completed proof as a downloadable `.lean` file attachment (not inline code)
- On error: the error message in the summary text (no file attachment)

### Health Check

The bot exposes an HTTP health endpoint (default: port 8080):

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "uptime_seconds": 3600.5,
  "socket_mode_connected": true,
  "events": {
    "total_received": 42,
    "message_events": 30,
    "app_mention_events": 10,
    "ignored_events": 2
  },
  "last_event": {
    "timestamp_iso": "2026-03-04T12:00:00Z",
    "seconds_ago": 5.2
  },
  "registered_listeners": ["message", "app_mention"]
}
```
